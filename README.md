# whitesands-examples

A collection of example script that handle automatic interaction with whitesands.p3ki.net.

To run the script at full speed, simply execute them:

`./smarthome_handshake.sh`

If you want the script to run automatically but pause between steps, simply specify a delay (in seconds):

`DELAY=5 ./smarthome_handshake.sh`

For even more control, enable manual stepping to allow you to decide your own pace:

`MANUAL=1 ./smarthome_handshake.sh`
